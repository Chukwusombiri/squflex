    <x-faq-item trigger="What is {{config('app.name')}}’s investment strategy?">
        {{config('app.name')}} creates portfolios of investments that are well diversified across markets, and are anticipated to do well in the long run. We think this is the best approach to invest in financial markets for the vast majority of people. It is extremely difficult to beat the market, and the data indicates that very few active managers are able to do it on a regular basis—especially when accounting for their fees. Furthermore, it's extremely difficult to identify which managers will exceed the market in advance, even if some do.
        For investors, the capacity to persist with an investment strategy and save a sufficient amount of money are the most essential factors in determining wealth. For this reason, we offer a technological experience that is designed to help you invest long-term, advisors who are here to answer questions and help you stick to your plan, and a variety of portfolio themes that align with your values and goals.

    <x-faq-item trigger="What kind of returns should I expect?">
        We firmly believe that financial assets will beat cash and that returns will roughly correspond to the total riskiness of the portfolio. Our riskiest portfolios typically yield higher returns over the rate of volatility over lengthy time horizons, while less risky portfolios will earn slightly less. While any given year can have a wide range of results, you can feel sure that investing in low-cost, diverse portfolios and saving consistently over time is an excellent approach to accumulate wealth. Viewing your own projection based on the amount of risk in your portfolio and the deposits you make is possible once you register for an account and are matched with a portfolio.

    <x-faq-item trigger="How do I know which portfolio is right for me?">
        The ideal portfolio for you will ultimately be one that you can maintain and continue to invest in despite market fluctuations. Long-term success for investors is attributed to this. We will ask you a few questions to match you with the appropriate portfolio, such as what you're investing for, when you plan to need the money, and how comfortable you are with portfolio swings. Although your portfolio will be unique to your circumstances, in general, the longer you have to invest, the more risk you may accept because you will have plenty of time to recover any losses you may have in the near term.

    <x-faq-item trigger="What counts towards the $10,000 or $50,000 minimums?">
